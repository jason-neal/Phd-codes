This is a crazy mess but if I don't make it public now I never will.

These python codes deal with Wavelength calibration and telluric correction of CRIRES spectra reduced with IRAF.
A lot of stuff is plotting, and hard coded to my data and directory structure (sorry).

If you want to use something and need help understanding, feel free to ask.
